Please make sure you add your own items to your database.

        name = "coal_crate", -- name of the crate item in the database MUST IMPORT YOUR OWN
        label = "Crate of coal", -- Label of the crate - for notifications
        requiredItem = "coal", -- Required item to create the crate  MUST IMPORT YOUR OWN
        requiredQuantity = 50, -- Required quantity of the item to create the crate
